ABSTRACT SUPERTYPE OF   (ONEOF(IfcStructuralCurveMember, IfcStructuralSurfaceMember)) 



IfcStructuralCurveMember
Net:
  http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC2x4/beta1/html/ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralcurvemember.htmDefinition from IAI: 
Definition from IAI: 
  Instances of IfcStructuralCurveMember describe edge members, i.e. structural analysis idealizations 
  of beams, columns, rods etc.. Curve members may be straight or curved.
Topology Use Definitions:
  Direct instances of IfcStructuralCurveMember shall have a topology representation 
  which consists of one instance of IfcEdge or a subtype, representing the reference curve of the curve member.
  See definitions at IfcStructuralItem for further specifications.


IfcStructuralSurfaceMember
Net:
  http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC2x4/beta1/html/ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralsurfacemember.htm
Definition from IAI: 
  Instances of IfcStructuralSurfaceMember describe face members, i.e. structural analysis idealizations
  of slabs, walls, shells, etc.. Surface members may be planar or curved.
Topology Use Definitions:
  Direct instances of IfcStructuralSurfaceMember shall have a topology representation 
  which consists of one IfcFaceSurface, representing the reference surface of the surface member. 
  See definitions at IfcStructuralItem for further specifications.
